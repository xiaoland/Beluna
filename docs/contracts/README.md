# README of docs/contracts

These contracts describe behavior at a module boundary and answer "What must be true at the boundary".

They should be:

- precise
- deterministic
- testable
- implementation-agnostic

They come from `docs/features` user stories and acceptance criteria.
They are executable specifications for writing behavior-driven tests.
