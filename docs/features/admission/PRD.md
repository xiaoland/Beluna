# Admission PRD

Admission is the effectuation gate.

Invariants:

- Admission is mechanics only; it does not interpret intent semantics.

Requirements:

- Consume non-binding `IntentAttempt[]`.
- Enforce hard affordance constraints and economic constraints mechanically.
- Produce explicit per-attempt outcomes and admitted action batches.
