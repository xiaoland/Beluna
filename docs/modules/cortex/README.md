# Cortex Module

Cortex is the always-on deliberative reactor module.

Code:
- `core/src/cortex/*`

Key properties:
- inbox-event driven `react` loop
- stateless durable boundary (no internal goal/commitment persistence)
- primary prose IR + sub-compile pipeline
- deterministic clamp final authority
- attempts are deterministic and non-binding
